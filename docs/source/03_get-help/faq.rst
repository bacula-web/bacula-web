.. _supported-web-browser:

Which web browsers can be used with Bacula-Web ?
------------------------------------------------

Bacula-Web is compatible with almost all well known web browser. The only thing youâ€™ve to worry about is to make sure that Javascript is enabled.

Before releasing a new version, I usually make some tests with latest version of Firefox, Chrome ad Internet Explorer.
Don't hesitate to share your experience with any other web browser by giving to me a positive/negative feedback.

As of Bacula-Web version 8.5.0, the recommended PHP version is version <= 7.4

.. important:: PHP versions prior to 7.4 are not supported anymore, theses versions no longer have security support and are exposed to non patched security vulnerabilities.

For more details, please have a look at the `currently supported PHP version`_ (PHP.net website)

.. _Download page: http://bacula-web.org/download.html

.. _bug-feature-request:

--------------------------------------------

Register or log in (if you already registered) in the `bug tracker`_ and submit your bug and/or feature request.

.. _bug tracker: http://bugs.bacula-web.org

Bacula-Web support Bacula catalog running on MySQL, postgreSQL and SQlite database.

.. _requirements:

What are the requirements to use Bacula-Web on my server ?
----------------------------------------------------------

A full :ref:`list of requirements <install/requirements>` is documented in the documentation section.

.. _supported-os:

On which OS can I install Bacula-Web ?
--------------------------------------

Bacula-Web is currently developed and tested under Centos 6 and Red Hat EL version 5.

But it should work fine on your preferred Linux distributions as

  * Debian/Ubuntu (or any kind of Debian based distros)
  * Gentoo
  * Slackware
  * OpenSuse
  * Fedora
  * etc.

Bacula-Web should work as well on XAMPP but without any warranty (not tested yet).

If you intend to install Bacula-web on WAMP (Windows + Apache + PHP + MySQL), it should work without problems. 
You just need to ensure that PHP has been compiled with the bacula's database support (MySQL, postgreSQL, SQLite) and PDO as well.

In case you need further help, don't hesitate to get back to me by mail (bacula-dev at dflc dot ch)

.. _troubleshoot-blank-page:

I've installed Bacula-Web without issue but I got a blank page
--------------------------------------------------------------

You've installed and configured Bacula-Web and what you got is just a blank page.

So, first, ensure that running the test page, everything is ok (use the link below)

::

  http://yourserver/bacula-web/test.php

If it doesn't solve the problem, verify your Apache's error log and search for an error message.

.. _troubleshoot-selinux:

Why I can't connect to remote db server with SELinux enforced ?
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you gave right permissions and access to your database user, I guess that SELinux is the problem

Check your log file (/var/log/audit/audit.log on RedHat/Centos) for the error below

::

  type=AVC msg=audit(1346832664.222:2491): avc:  denied  { name_connect } for  pid=3427 comm="httpd" dest=3306 scontext=unconfined_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:mysqld_port_t:s0 tclass=tcp_socket
  type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1346832664.222:2491): arch=40000003 syscall=102 success=no exit=-13 a0=3 a1=bfb94dd0 a2=b63d80c0 a3=c items=0 ppid=3421 pid=3427 auid=0 uid=48 gid=48 euid=48 suid=48 fsuid=48 egid=48 sgid=48 fsgid=48 tty=(none) ses=32 comm="httpd" exe="/usr/sbin/httpd" subj=unconfined_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 key=(null)

and disable SELinux on your server

::

  $ sudo setenforce permissive

or

::

  $ sudo setenforce disabled

.. _troubleshoot-selinux-enforced:

Does Bacula-Web can run on a system having SELinux enforced ?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The short answer is **yes**.

The long answer is below

If nothing seems to be working and you are using SELinux, please remember that you must have the correct contexts for the bacula-web files. Assuming you have installed the files in this directory

:: 

  /var/www/html/bacula-web

you can fix the SELinux context by running the command below

::

  $ sudo chcon -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/bacula-web/ -R

Otherwise, the simplest would be to set SELinux to Permissive or Disabled

.. _development-status:

What's the current development status of Bacula-Web ?
------------------------------------------------------

As described in Bacula-Web project story, I revived the Bacula-Web project since end of 2010 after few years without bug fixes and improvements.
As you already know, a lot of effort has been made a provide more stable, secure and useful tool.

But there's still a lot of things to do but since version 5.1.0 alpha, Bacula-Web is slightly stable.

For people that use Bacula-Web on a daily basis, you already know that they're a lot improvement to achieve.
That's what I'll try to do on my spare time and hope you'll enjoy

.. _project-revive:

Why reviving Bacula-Web project ?
---------------------------------

Since several years, I'm using as you this amazing open source backup tool Bacula and I was looking for a web based tool that provide me useful information about last night jobs.

My first look were on WeBacula and bweb which are nice to use and features full but maybe pretty much not easy to install and configure.

Then, I've found Bacula-Web which wasn't patched and updated since many years.

I submitted patches to Bacula developer list and after some commit, i proposed to become the official maintainer of this project. That's was on July 2010.

I know that there's a lot of web based console for managing, monitoring and configuring bacula like

  * bweb
  * bat
  * Webacula

You can also find a complete list of GUI in the Bacula's web site

Because bacula-web stand to be (for both next patch and future release)

  * Really easy to install, configure and upgrade
  * Easy to use (after you've successfully installed, you just need a web browser, no GUI)
  * Useful (see roadmap for the next version's coming)

I do use Bacula-Web for personal usage several time per week, and the idea was simply to share those improvements with the community

  * Fixes and enhancement I've created on my side
  * Added features such as a new test page
  * Improved design
  * Fixed some SQL query bugs (MySQL and postgreSQL)
