Known limitations
-----------------

As of now, Bacula-Web is only a reporting and monitoring tool, it only access your Bacula director (read only) to retrieve information from Bacula catalog.

I have plan to include more features such as starting, canceling backup or restore jobs for example.
This will come in the future but you'll need to be patient as the whole application code needs to be rewritten.
