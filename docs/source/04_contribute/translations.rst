How to help translating Bacula-Web
----------------------------------

To change the language of your own Bacula-Web installation, read the chapter Configuring Bacula-Web in the documentation.

As of now, Bacula-Web translations are fully managed using the Transifex tool.

Please have a look at `Bacula-Web project at Transifex`_

If you want to help the project by updating the translations or create new ones, here's the step you need to follow

   * register or sign-in on `Transifex.com`_ website
   * request to participate in the Bacula-Web project
   * Once I've approved your request, you will be able to update languages translations

If you want me to create a new language for Bacula-Web, please send me message, I'll do it with pleasure.

Using this tool is pretty easy but if you need a bit of help, do not hesitate to get back to me using the project `GitHub issues`_.
