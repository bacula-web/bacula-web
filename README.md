![Bacula-Web dashboard](https://www.bacula-web.org/bacula-web-dashboard.png)

Bacula-Web is a web based tool written in [PHP](https://php.net) which provides a summarized view of your [Bacula](https://www.bacula.org) backup infrastructure.

All the metrics and information provided by Bacula-Web are taken from [Bacula](https://www.bacula.org) catalog database, so there's no need to set up bconsole, bvfs, etc

In addition, the accesses to the database are made read-only, so your Bacula catalog is not altered by Bacula-Web

### Why this project ?

Bacula-Web project has been revived since 2010.

I thought that having an easy and useful web UI to monitor Bacula backup jobs, volumes, pools, etc. would be nice.
So I decided to take care of this project which was almost abandoned since more than 4 years.

For more information, please check the [project history](https://docs.bacula-web.org/en/latest/01_about/about.html#the-project-history)

> This project is just my little contribution to [Bacula](http://www.bacula.org) community project.
> I hope you'll find it useful and enjoy it !
